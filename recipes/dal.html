        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This recipe was passed down from my grandmother. Normally, you would simmer the dal for hours,
             but I have found this too time-consuming. It is eqully as delicious and even easier in an
             Instant Pot.
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup of washed dal, consisting of an even mix of these 4 different types of dal:
                <ul>
                    <li>Chana dal</li>
                    <li>Toor dal</li>
                    <li>Masoor dal</li>
                    <li>Moong dal</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>1 onion</li>

            <li>Coriander to garnish (optional).</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>

            <li>Grind the ginger, onion, garlic, chillies and turmeric in a blender until smooth.</li>
            <li>Heat the oil in a large wok on high heat for a minute. Then fry the
