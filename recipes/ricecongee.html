        <h3 class="description">Description</h3>
        <p>When I was a kid, my mum would call this porridge. When I moved to a Western country, this caused much confusion
            between me and my new Australian classmates.
        </p>
        <p>This is a great simple meal for if you ever feel sick and need something easy on the stomach and throat.</p>
        <p><b>NOTE:</b> you will need a rice cooker for this recipe.</p>
        <h3 class="ingredients">Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>

            <li>Wash the rice and put it in the rice cooker. Add water up to the porridge line. If there are no markings
                on your rice cooker, add 4 parts water for every part rice.

            <li>Break the raw mince into small chunks and add it to the rice.</li>
            <li>Add the salt to the pot.</li>
